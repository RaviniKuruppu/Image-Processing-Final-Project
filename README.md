# Image Processing Project ðŸ“¸

This Python-based image processing project is developed for the final assignment, utilizing Google Colab for execution. The project aims to enhance the quality of a given sample image (`sampleimage.png`) through various image-processing tasks.

## Project Structure

- **Code Folder:**
  - Contains the Python code implementing the image processing tasks.
  
- **Output Image Folder:**
  - Stores the output images obtained after applying different filters/algorithms.

## Tasks

### Step 1: Load and Convert to Greyscale
Load the provided sample image and convert it into greyscale, 8bpp format.

### Step 2: Image Enhancement
Enhance the image quality through the following operations:
- Noise filtering
- Contrast stretching
- De-blurring (sharpening)
- Any other appropriate image enhancement operation

Try at least two different filters/algorithms for each stage. Save the output and compute Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for each.

### Step 3: Plot Histogram
Plot the histogram of the final enhanced image.

### Step 4: Compute Entropy and Compression Ratio
Compute the entropy of the image and determine the best achievable compression ratio compared to an 8bpp grayscale representation.

## Execution Instructions
1. Execute the Python code in the `code` folder using Google Colab or a compatible environment.
2. The `Output Images` folder contains images generated at each step of the process
3. Analyze the results and computations for each step.
